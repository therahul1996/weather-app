# Weather App

[Live demo](https://weather-app-gray-psi-53.vercel.app/)

I've developed a weather app using React JS and the OpenWeather API. The app provides real-time weather information, including your current location. Users can search for the weather by city name. Additionally, I've implemented a sleek dark and light mode for enhanced user experience.
